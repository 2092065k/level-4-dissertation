\title{Implementations of Advanced K-Means Clustering Algorithms \\ for Spark/MLlib}
\author{Ivan Kyosev}
\date{March 21, 2017}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It emphasizes speed, ease of use and generality in regards to working with Big Data. Its feature-set provides an alternative to the popular Hadoop MapReduce software framework, displaying a noticeable performance improvement. One of Spark's many components is MLlib. It is a machine learning library built on top of the core features of Spark and provides implementations for a variety of popular machine learning algorithms, written in a way meant to support scalability when operating on big data sets.

This paper presents a proposed extension to the MLlib component of Apache Spark in the form of additional K-Means Clustering algorithms that the library does not currently support. K-Means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. A thorough analysis of the performance of the newly created algorithms and the relative quality of the produced data models is also conducted.

\section{Report outline}

The remainder of this report will focus on the mathematics underlying each of the considered K-Means clustering algorithms as well as the challenges of implementing them in a scalable fashion under Spark:
\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter~\ref{spark} covers the data processing model provided by Apache Spark and its machine learning library MLlib
\item Chapter~\ref{kmeans} explains the most common iterative K-Means Clustering algorithm and outlines its existing implementation in MLlib
\item Chapter~\ref{online} details Lloyd's Online K-Means Clustering algorithm and two different approaches to its implementation
\item Chapter~\ref{art} presents a version of K-Means using Adaptive Resonance Theory and its implementation
\item Chapter~\ref{som} presents a K-Means Clustering algorithm using Self-Organizing Maps and its implementation
\item Chapter~\ref{eval} covers a variety of ways to evaluate both the performance of the presented algorithms and the quality of the data models they produce
\item Chapter~\ref{conclusion} Concludes this report with a reflection on the whole project
\end{itemize}

maybe add an evaluation section earlier to each part\\
add chapter comparing algorithms at the end\\
both would need to explain evaluation method earlier\\
make a reference to the used training data
