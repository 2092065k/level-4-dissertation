\title{Implementations of Advanced K-Means Clustering Algorithms \\ for Spark/MLlib}
\author{Ivan Kyosev}
\date{March 21, 2017}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It emphasizes speed, ease of use and generality in regards to working with Big Data. Its feature-set provides an alternative to the popular Hadoop MapReduce software framework, displaying a noticeable performance improvement. One of Spark's many components is MLlib. It is a machine learning library built on top of the core features of Spark and provides implementations for a variety of popular machine learning algorithms, written in a way meant to support scalability when operating on big data sets.

This paper presents a proposed extension to the MLlib component of Apache Spark in the form of additional K-Means Clustering algorithms that the library does not currently support. K-Means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. A thorough analysis of the performance of the newly created algorithms and the relative quality of the produced data models is also conducted.

The remainder of this report will focus on the mathematics underlying each of the considered K-Means clustering algorithms as well as the challenges of implementing them in a scalable fashion under Spark:
\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter~\ref{spark} covers the data processing model provided by Apache Spark and its machine learning library MLlib
\item Chapter~\ref{kmeans} explains the most common used versions of K-Means Clustering algorithms
\item Chapter~\ref{previous} discusses the approach taken by Spark's developers to create the current clustering API
\item Chapter~\ref{propose} outlines the proposed algorithms to be implemented as part of Apache Sparks, along with their benefits and challenges
\item Chapter~\ref{online} details two different approaches to the implementation of Lloyd's Online K-Means Clustering algorithm
\item Chapter~\ref{art} presents a version of K-Means using Adaptive Resonance Theory and its implementation
\item Chapter~\ref{som} presents the implementation of a  a K-Means Clustering algorithm using Self-Organizing Maps
\item Chapter~\ref{eval} covers a variety of ways to evaluate both the performance of the presented algorithms and the quality of the data models they produce
\item Chapter~\ref{conclusion} Concludes this report with a reflection on the whole project
\end{itemize}

maybe add an evaluation section earlier to each part\\
add chapter comparing algorithms at the end\\
both would need to explain evaluation method earlier\\
make a reference to the used training data
